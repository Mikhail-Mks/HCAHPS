# Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems Analysis

This project focused on National & state-level scores from 2013 to 2022 for the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey, a national, standardized survey of hospital patients about their experiences during a recent inpatient hospital stay.

The Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey is a national, standardized survey of hospital patients about their experiences during a recent inpatient hospital stay. It is administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) to measure patients’ perspectives of hospital care and to provide a basis for comparison across hospitals. The survey consists of 19 questions that cover nine topics: communication with doctors, communication with nurses, responsiveness of hospital staff, pain management, communication about medicines, discharge information, cleanliness of the hospital environment, quietness of the hospital environment, and transition of care. In this project, I will analyze the national and state-level scores from 2013 to 2022 for the HCAHPS survey.

 - The patients are the primary focus of this project, as they are the ones who provide feedback on their hospital stay through the HCAHPS survey. The survey asks them to rate various aspects of their care on a scale from never to always, or from 0 to 10. The patients’ responses reflect their perceptions and expectations of the care they received, as well as their satisfaction and loyalty to the hospital.

 - The doctors are one of the key providers of care for the patients in the hospital. They are responsible for diagnosing, treating, and managing the patients’ medical conditions, as well as educating them about their health issues and options. The HCAHPS survey measures how well the doctors communicate with the patients, how often they treat them with courtesy and respect, how often they listen carefully to them, and how often they explain things in a way they can understand.

- The nurses are another essential provider of care for the patients in the hospital. They are responsible for administering medications, monitoring vital signs, performing procedures, and providing emotional support. The HCAHPS survey measures how well the nurses communicate with the patients, how often they treat them with courtesy and respect, how often they listen carefully to them, and how often they explain things in a way they can understand.

The hospital staff includes other personnel who are involved in different aspects of care for the patients in the hospital. They include technicians, pharmacists, housekeepers, administrators, and others who perform various tasks such as testing, dispensing, cleaning, billing, and coordinating. The HCAHPS survey measures how responsive the hospital staff are to the patients’ needs, how often they help them as soon as they want it, how often they help them get to the bathroom or use a bedpan as soon as they want it, how clean they keep their room and bathroom, and how quiet they keep their area at night.
