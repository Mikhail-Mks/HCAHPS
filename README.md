# Patient satisfaction survey analysis for hospitals 

This project focused on National & state-level scores from 2013 to 2022 for the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey, a national, standardized survey of hospital patients about their experiences during a recent inpatient hospital stay.

The Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey is a national, standardized survey of hospital patients about their experiences during a recent inpatient hospital stay. It is administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) to measure patients’ perspectives of hospital care and to provide a basis for comparison across hospitals. The survey consists of 19 questions that cover nine topics: communication with doctors, communication with nurses, responsiveness of hospital staff, pain management, communication about medicines, discharge information, cleanliness of the hospital environment, quietness of the hospital environment, and transition of care. In this project, I have analyzed the national and state-level scores from 2013 to 2022 for the HCAHPS survey.

 - **The patients** are the primary focus of this project, as they are the ones who provide feedback on their hospital stay through the HCAHPS survey. The survey asks them to rate various aspects of their care on a scale from never to always, or from 0 to 10. The patients’ responses reflect their perceptions and expectations of the care they received, as well as their satisfaction and loyalty to the hospital.

 - **The doctors** are one of the key providers of care for the patients in the hospital. They are responsible for diagnosing, treating, and managing the patients’ medical conditions, as well as educating them about their health issues and options. The HCAHPS survey measures how well the doctors communicate with the patients, how often they treat them with courtesy and respect, how often they listen carefully to them, and how often they explain things in a way they can understand.

- **The nurses** are another essential provider of care for the patients in the hospital. They are responsible for administering medications, monitoring vital signs, performing procedures, and providing emotional support. The HCAHPS survey measures how well the nurses communicate with the patients, how often they treat them with courtesy and respect, how often they listen carefully to them, and how often they explain things in a way they can understand.

- **The hospital staff** includes other personnel who are involved in different aspects of care for the patients in the hospital. They include technicians, pharmacists, housekeepers, administrators, and others who perform various tasks such as testing, dispensing, cleaning, billing, and coordinating. The HCAHPS survey measures how responsive the hospital staff are to the patients’ needs, how often they help them as soon as they want it, how often they help them get to the bathroom or use a bedpan as soon as they want it, how clean they keep their room and bathroom, and how quiet they keep their area at night.

The relationship between the patients and the doctors is crucial for ensuring effective and safe care. For example, some patients may feel rushed or ignored by their doctors, or may not receive enough information or education about their condition or treatment options.

Patient care quality and compassion depend on patient-nurse interactions. However, some patients may receive delayed or incorrect medications, or inadequate pain management or emotional support from their nurses.

How patients and hospital staff interact is important for a comfortable and safe environment. Most patients say hospital staff respond and keep things clean, but some patients experience long wait times, staff shortages, or noise and dirt.

The patients’ main goal is to receive high-quality care and to recover from their illness or injury. They want to be treated with respect and dignity by the hospital staff and to receive clear and timely information about their care plan. They also want to feel comfortable and safe in their hospital environment.

However, the patients might encounter some difficulties during their stay that could affect their satisfaction and outcomes. For example, they might experience pain or discomfort after surgery, they might have trouble sleeping due to noise or light in their room, they might have adverse reactions to some medications, or they might not receive adequate discharge instructions or follow-up care.

Over a period of nine years, patients in 5,245 facilities across the nation have been questioned. However, we discover a significant obstacle: in 12.40% of these facilities, patients provided no responses, signaling a critical disconnect between patients and the healthcare system.

The most alarming revelation is the decline in the average response rate over the years, dropping from a commendable 30.84% to a concerning 22.74% across all states.

</p>


 This decline is visually depicted in a line graph, which paints a vivid picture of our character's struggle. Peaks and valleys in the graph represent the highs and lows of patient engagement, emphasizing the dramatic need for improvement.

The most significant drop in response rate is observed in Utah and Idaho, with -15.72% and -12.27%, respectively, while South Dakota fared slightly better with only a -2.63% drop.

The map displays how the decline in response rates is distributed across different states.

If we look at response trends on a global level, we will see either no positive changes or a decline, especially in interaction with doctors and communication about medicine.

Interaction with doctors shows positive responses in only four states: Alaska, Montana, South Dakota, and North Dakota. No changes are seen in Minnesota and Utah, while the rest of the states experience a decline. Generally, central and northern states perform better, but Maine stands out as the worst performer, especially in terms of cleanliness with an 11% decrease in performance.

Interactions with hospital staff, while generally better, still present challenges. The information about symptoms and health problems provided after leaving the hospital is a significant concern. Although around 30% of states maintain consistent interaction levels, Western and Central states exhibit positive trends in their interactions with nurses, while Eastern states suffer a significant decline of up to 8%.

It is important to note that this decline began in October 2019, marking a pivotal moment in our story, where our character faces increasing challenges.

### Top-performing states:

**Alaska** and **North Dakota** have a relatively small population and a low population density, which could make it easier for hospitals to provide personalised and timely care to their patients.

**Alaska** and **North Dakota** have invested in improving their health care infrastructure and workforce, especially in rural areas. For example, Alaska has expanded its telehealth services and increased its number of primary care physicians. North Dakota has supported its critical access hospitals and referral centres and implemented a statewide trauma system.

**Alaska** and **North Dakota** have adopted innovative and collaborative approaches to address the behavioural health needs of their residents, especially children and adolescents. For example, Alaska has launched a project to improve acute behavioural health services and coordinate care across the continuum. North Dakota has established a behavioural health division and a children’s cabinet to oversee and coordinate the delivery of behavioural health services.

**Montana’s** hospitals received more federal funding and support to expand their services and capacity, especially in rural areas, under the Affordable Care Act 2. For example, Montana’s hospitals benefited from the Medicaid expansion, the Medicare rural hospital flexibility programmeme, and the community health centre programmeme.

Montana’s hospitals participated in various initiatives and collaborations to enhance their performance and outcomes, such as the Montana Rural Healthcare Performance Improvement Network, the Montana Health Network, and the Montana Hospital Improvement Innovation Network.

### Worst performing states:

**New Hampshire**: New Hampshire has faced a shortage of health care workers, especially in rural areas, due to low wages, high turnover, and a lack of training opportunities. The state has also struggled to provide adequate mental health services, resulting in high rates of suicide, substance abuse, and homelessness among the population. A lawsuit alleges that the state psychiatric hospital has been poorly run, and neglect has hastened patient deaths. These factors may have affected the quality of care and patient satisfaction in New Hampshire hospitals.

**Arizona**: The state has been criticised for its lack of transparency and accountability in reporting and investigating hospital errors and infections. These issues may have contributed to the decline in positive hospital responses in Arizona. The state also faced challenges in expanding its health care coverage and access, especially for low-income and uninsured residents, and in improving its health care quality and outcomes, especially for rural and Native American populations.

**Maine**: Maine had a higher uninsured rate and lower access to care than the national average, according to a report by the Commonwealth Fund. The report also criticised Maine for its lack of progress in implementing the Affordable Care Act and expanding its Medicaid programme, which left many residents without affordable and comprehensive health insurance. However, the state also had some strengths in its health care system, such as its high rate of primary care providers, its low rate of hospital-acquired infections, and its participation in various initiatives and collaborations to enhance its performance and outcomes.

The main area of concern identified through our discoveries centers around the provision of information about medications, the need for better understanding in doctor-patient interactions, and the urgency in reducing wait times.

We can draw inspiration from top-performing states such as Alaska, North Dakota, and Montana. These states have smaller populations and lower population density, allowing for personalized and timely care. They have invested in healthcare infrastructure, workforce, and innovative approaches to address behavioral health needs.

However, we must not forget the challenges faced by the worst-performing states, including New Hampshire, Arizona, and Maine. These states grapple with healthcare worker shortages, mental health service deficiencies, and challenges in expanding healthcare coverage and access.
